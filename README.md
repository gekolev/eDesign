# Know Thyself

*Known issues for this project to have -*

### Viewing locally without a server

When viewing without a server the background-images result in a 404 error because of the routing.

### Overall sizing

Mostly proportional, but not quite. I would give myself an 8/10 for eyeballing the sizes and margins. 

### Font sizing

Started with rem - ended with viewport width. Should have committed to rem - would have sized for mobile more adequately. 

### Repeating CSS properties

Should have started mobile first, since I didn't I handicapped myself when it comes to styling later. Unnecessary classes and repetition in media queries. Needs a css purge. 

### Vanilla js 

I guess this might be a plus? tbh anything is better than jquery. However I am importing a fontawesome icon for the hamburger menu ...

### Exporting assets

Exporting assets from photoshop was clunky, file sizes are most definitely not optimized. Couldn't export slider arrows.

### Burger Menu

On open- displays elements inside of the div containing the background image - stretches and resizes the image - can cause % issues

### Mobile version

Just overall bad. No comment. 

### Browser support

Hasn't been tested on different browsers/virtual machines.

### :/
